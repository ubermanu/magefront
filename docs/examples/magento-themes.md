# Magento Themes

Here is the compatibility list, as of Magento ~2.4.0:

- [x] Magento/blank
- [ ] Magento/luma
- [ ] Magento/backend

### Usage

    magefront build --theme Magento/blank

If you have a problem, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ubermanu/magefront).

**Magefront** aims to be compatible as much as possible with the core themes which is not an easy task, with the difference in LESS versions.
