# LESS

The LESS plugin transpiles LESS files to CSS.

It is based on the [gulp-less](https://github.com/gulp-community/gulp-less) plugin, and therefore accepts the same options.

> ðŸ’¡ This plugin is enabled by default if no configuration is defined

### Usage

```js
import less from 'magefront-plugin-less'

export default {
    plugins: [less()]
}
```
